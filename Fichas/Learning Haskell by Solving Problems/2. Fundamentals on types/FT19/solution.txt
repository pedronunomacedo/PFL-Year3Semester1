The function f computes the second largest element of a list by scanning it only once.

Additional information :
  - An auxiliary function g contains two extra arguments to store the largest and the
    second largest elements found so far. In the base case of function g, the second
    largest element (i.e. the third argument) is returned. The recursion cases of g
    and he definition of f use guards to ensure g's extra arguments are always
    correctly updated.
