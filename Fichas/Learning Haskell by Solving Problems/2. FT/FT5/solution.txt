a) [1,2]
b) [1,2]
c) error - The right operand in cons must always be a list
d) error - The concatenation is invalid since the first operand is a list of integers and the last one is a list of lists of integers
e) [1,2,3,4]
f) 2
g) 'd' - When we have "(...)!!3", the "!!3" it means the character in index 3
h) 3 - The "init" function returns all elements except the last one
i) [[2],[1]] - The operator ":" constructs a list by taking an element and a list. The operator "++" concatenates lists.
                So, in this case, we can consider the first element as being the "[1]", and when we do ":" we need a list as a second argument.
                So, we will have, as a result, a list of lists.
j) "aaa" - The function repeat, will make an infinite string of a's. And when we use the function "take" with number 3, we only want the string of length 3.
k) "abcdabcd..."
l) [('a',1),('a',2),('a',3)] - The function 'repeat' will repeat the character 'a' infinite times. The function "zip" will join together the elements of two
                                lists with the same index. The result will be a list of tuples. The function "zip" works with different lengths of the two
                                lists, and the result list will have the length of the shortest list.
