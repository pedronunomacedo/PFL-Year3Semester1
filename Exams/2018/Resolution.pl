% 1) The program generates two lists, L1 and L2, where L1 has size N and L2 has size N-1. 
%    Each element of each list must be within the range [1,M]. The fulness of this lists is done by the fill predicate.
%    The sum of each consecutive pair of List1 is equal to the element of List2.
%    For example, given N = 4 and M = 10.
%    A possible solution would be L1 = [1,2,4,5] and L2 = [3,6,9].
%    The check predicate ensures that: 1+2 = 3, 2+4 = 6 and 4+5 = 9.
